> **The Scenario:** You're sketching a project architecture in a text file, or maybe ChatGPT just generated a perfect folder structure for you. 
>
> **The Problem:** Manually creating specifically nested folders and files is tedious, error-prone, and slow.
>
> **The Solution:** Feed that text into **tr2rl**. It parses seemingly "broken" or "messy" trees and instantly builds the real file structure for you.

---

## 🐣 Quick Start for Humans (Layman's Guide)

**"I just want to create folders from ChatGPT."**
1.  Copy the tree text from ChatGPT.
2.  Open your terminal in the folder where you want the project.
3.  Run: `tr2rl build --clipboard`

**"I want to see what it will do BEFORE it creates files."**
1.  Use the "Dry Run" flag:
2.  Run: `tr2rl build --clipboard --dry-run`
3.  It will print a list of "Would create..." lines. If it looks good, run it again without `--dry-run`.

**"I have this messy text from a friend."**
1.  Paste it into a file called `plan.txt`.
2.  Run: `tr2rl build plan.txt`

## ✨ Features

*   **🪄 Magic Parsing**: Smartly understands Unicode trees (`└──`), ASCII trees (`|--`), Indented lists, and even messy, mixed-format text.
*   **🛠️ Build & Populate**: Creates directories and files instantly. Can auto-fill files with language-specific boilerplate (e.g., `package main` for Go).
*   **🧹 Refine & Format**: Takes messy "napkin-sketch" text and formats it into a pristine, professional Unicode tree string.
*   **🛡️ Safety Preview**: Use `--dry-run` to see exactly what *would* happen before it touches your disk.
*   **📋 Clipboard Mode**: Build or format directly from your system clipboard. No temporary files needed.
*   **🚀 Zero Dependencies**: A single, static binary. Runs anywhere (Windows, macOS, Linux).

## 🚀 Examples

Here are some real-world commands to get you started.

### 1. The "Grand Finale" Build
Build a complex project structure from a file, verifying it first.
```powershell
# Preview what will be created (Dry Run)
.\tr2rl.exe build testdata/grand_finale.tree --dry-run

# Actually create the structure
.\tr2rl.exe build testdata/grand_finale.tree
```

### 2. Real-World Cookbooks
We've included production-ready architectures in the `examples/` folder.
```powershell
# Microservices with K8s & Docker
.\tr2rl.exe build examples/microservices-k8s.tree ./my-cluster --populate

# Next.js Fullstack (App Router, Tailwind, Supabase)
.\tr2rl.exe build examples/nextjs-fullstack.tree ./my-app --populate

# Python Data Science Project (Cookiecutter style)
.\tr2rl.exe build examples/data-science.tree ./analysis --populate
```

### 3. Instant Clipboard Build
Copy a tree from a chat window or website, then run:
```powershell
.\tr2rl.exe build --clipboard
```

### 3. Cleanup & Formatting
Turn a messy text file into a clean, shareable tree diagram.
```powershell
# Format a file
.\tr2rl.exe format testdata/grand_finale.tree

# Format text currently in your clipboard
.\tr2rl.exe format --clipboard
```

## 📦 Installation

### Option 1: Pre-compiled Binaries (Recommended)
Download the latest binary for your OS from the [**Releases Page**](https://github.com/tr2rl/tr2rl/releases).

| OS | Installation |
|:---|:---|
| **Windows** | Download `.exe` and add to your system `PATH` (or run locally like `.\tr2rl.exe`) |
| **Linux/Mac** | `chmod +x tr2rl` and move to `/usr/local/bin/` |

### Option 2: Build from Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tr2rl/tr2rl.git
cd tr2rl
go build -o tr2rl.exe .
```

---

## 📖 Usage Guide

### `build`
Parses input text and creates the corresponding directory structure.

**Syntax:**
```bash
tr2rl build [file] [output-dir] [flags]
```

**Flags:**
*   `--dry-run`: Enable preview mode (do not write to disk). Default: `false`.
*   `--force`: Overwrite existing files.
*   `--populate`: Auto-fill created files with boilerplate content.
*   `--clipboard`: Read input from clipboard instead of a file.

### `format`
Reads messy input and outputs a clean, canonical Unicode tree. Great for documentation.

**Syntax:**
```bash
tr2rl format [file] [flags]
```

**Flags:**
*   `--style`: Output format. Options: `unicode` (default) or `ascii`.
*   `--clipboard`: Read input from clipboard.

### `template`
View built-in project templates to quick-start your development.

```bash
# List all templates
tr2rl template list

# Use a template (pipe it to build)
tr2rl template show react-vite | tr2rl build - ./my-app --dry-run=false
```

## 🧩 Supported Input Formats
tr2rl is context-aware and handles "noisy" input.

| Style | Example Input |
|:---|:---|
| **Unicode Tree** | `├── src/` |
| **ASCII Tree** | `|-- src/` or `+--- src/` |
| **Indented List** | `  src` (just spaces) |
| **Path List** | `root/src/main.go` |
